                                    The Tintale Education Foundation (TEF) was created in 2003 by PFCF team members William Aura and 
                                    Shyam Basnet in order to develop an educational center in the remote village of Tintale in eastern Nepal. 
                                    The project started in humble conditions and has evolved to a unique primary school with over 300 students 
                                    and 14 staff members. The Playing For Change Foundation is now supporting portions of the operating 
                                    budget of this school and we are planning to add several grades in the next few years in order to create 
                                    the first secondary school within Tintale. If most of our students come from the village there has been a 
                                    substantial increase in children coming from the surrounding villages.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The school has currently three facilities, including ten classrooms, bathrooms, a computer room, an open-air 
                                    courtyard, and a playground. In addition, the Mother’s Society center funded by the local municipality offers 
                                    space for music and dance classes. This school is the first school in the region that implemented compulsory 
                                    music education providing music lessons in traditional music, dance and singing classes.

                                    The vast majority of refugees are South Sudanese who have fled the ongoing civil conflict. Others come 
                                    from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, and Somalia. Most of the population in Bidi Bidi are

                                    Opera de Arame in Curitiba, in October 2014, that allowed us to raise a consistent amount of money to

                                    times a week for now, and the main focus of the music classes is currently what we call "musicalization" 
                                    which is basically a general introduction to music adapted to a young audience.

                                    Cajuru is located 7 kilometers from the center of Curitiba and has a population of about 90, 000. 
                                    The name "Cajuru" comes from a native word that means "the entrance of the wood".

                                    The “Fundación de Artes Musicales” (FAM) aims to support the teaching, promotion and dissemination 
                                    of music in Baja California with the purpose of contributing to the cultural development of the 
                                    region and the strengthening of its communities. FAM realizes its purpose through the Centro de 
                                    Artes Musicales (CAM), the Orquesta de Baja California (OBC) and the community program Redes 2025. 
                                    The main objective of the Redes 2025 program is to work on crime prevention through the power of 
                                    music and help transmit universal values of tolerance, respect, identity, and responsibility.

                                    Although the program operates in the most violent and vulnerable neighborhoods of the State of 
                                    Baja California, music is employed as a form to positively impact the living conditions of the 
                                    students, their families, and their communities-at-large. Three of the main issues that affect 
                                    our social fabric and that we approach through the program are violence, immigration and children's 
                                    rights to education.

                                order to support its Redes 2025 program, that operates 100% community orchestras and choirs in 
                                20 neighborhoods in the City of Tijuana.
